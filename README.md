#🏥 Predicting Hospital Readmissions with Machine Learning
This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict hospital readmissions using synthetic patient data. The goal is to help healthcare providers identify high-risk patients prior to discharge and reduce avoidable readmissions.

📊 Project Summary
Objective: Predict whether a patient will be readmitted within 30 days using clinical and demographic variables.

Dataset: 10,000+ synthetic patient records, including diagnosis codes, age ranges, visit counts, lab results, and diabetes medication status.

Models Used: Logistic Regression & Random Forest

Key Deliverables:

Feature importance analysis for top clinical risk factors

Classification reports and confusion matrices

Interactive Excel dashboards for non-technical stakeholders

🔍 Key Findings
Top Predictors of Readmission:

Number of inpatient visits

Emergency room visits

Diabetes medication usage

Older age groups (80–89)

Potential Impact:
Reducing avoidable readmissions by 5% could save $2.6B annually in U.S. healthcare costs.
